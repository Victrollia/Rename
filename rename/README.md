# Rename Images :sparkles:

- Open __Rename.exe__ _first_, to create the necessary folders
- Add images you want to rename in _upload_ folder
- Enter Manufacturer and MPN in the program to rename the images

## Important Notes:
:warning: If the program doesn't work because you don't have Python installed, please open _python-silent-install_ then try again.

:point_right: The renamed files will be moved to the _processed_ folder.
